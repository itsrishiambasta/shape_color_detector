# Shape & Color Detector using OpenCV 🎯🎨

This project detects **shapes** (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle, etc.) and their **colors** (Red, Green, Blue, etc.) live using a webcam with **Python + OpenCV**.

## 🧠 Features
- 🔺 Detect Triangle, Rectangle, Square, Circle, Pentagon, Hexagon
- 🔴 Detect dominant object color (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, etc.)
- 📸 Live video feed with labels like `Red Triangle` or `Blue Circle`
- 📝 Easily extendable to save images or log to CSV

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python numpy
    ```

2. Run the notebook:
    ```
    python main.ipynb
    ```

> Make sure your camera is working and allowed by the OS.

## 🤖 Future Ideas
- Count number of shapes
- Save detections to CSV
- Build GUI with buttons (Tkinter / PyQt)
